# HexEffect - Technical Overview

**HexEffect** is a Unity-based puzzle game focusing on hexagonal grid mechanics, word generation, and real-time gameplay interactions. Below is a concise breakdown of the key technical components and technologies used:

### Key Features:
- **Hex Grid**: Manages dynamic hexagonal grid creation and tile interactions (selecting, deselecting).
- **Word Generation & Validation**: Generates words based on grid spaces and validates them using a case-insensitive word list.
- **Procedural Generation**: Generates new levels with infinite configurations.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Ensures valid word placement and shape generation.

### Technologies Used:
- **Unity 6**: Game engine.
- **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**: For enhanced graphics and Bloom effect.
- **DOTween**: For smooth animations and visual transitions.

  
**HexEffect** is a flexible foundation for grid-based, word, and puzzle games, offering reusable components for grid management, input handling, and dynamic visual effects.
